# Risk Management: Assignment 3 – Equity Portfolio VaR/ES & Counterparty Risk

This repository contains the Python code and documentation for Risk Management Assignment 3, developed as part of the Financial Engineering course at Politecnico di Milano. The assignment covers various case studies, including:

- **Case Study 1:**  
  Calculation of daily VaR and Expected Shortfall (ES) for multiple equity portfolios using different approaches:
  - Gaussian parametric approach (with a 4-year estimation) for Portfolio 1.
  - Historical simulation and bootstrap method for Portfolio 2.
  - Weighted historical simulation (λ = 0.95) for Portfolio 3.
  - Gaussian parametric PCA approach for a 10-day VaR and ES in Portfolio 4.

- **Case Study 2:**  
  Assessment of a portfolio consisting of Anheuser-Busch stocks and put options. The code computes a 10-day/99% VaR using:
  - Monte Carlo simulation.
  - Delta normal approach (and its improvement).

- **Case Study 3:**  
  Pricing of a 5-year Cliquet option using market data and risk parameters from previous lab work.
